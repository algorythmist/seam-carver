# Seam Carving Demo

Seam carving is an algorithm for content-aware image resizing that preserves the more essential elements of an image while removing low information elements.

This is a Java implementation of the algorithm. The main program *SeamCarvingDemo* creates the resized picture that the algorithm produces as well as visual representations of the energy and the seams that were removed.
